This is a simple text and file encryption program made possible by OpenSSL, AES-256, and the BASH shell.

You can encrypt and decrypt [1] text files (made within this program), [2] files, and [3] compress and encrypt folders into archives from archives.
	
This program has absolutely no warranty... things may break, so just follow along with instructions (I have made some failsafes just incase)… I’m not responsible for anything that may go wrong.
	
This program uses aes-256-ecb 's encryption algorithm via the openssl command.

This is just download and run, no setup required!
Tested on Debian, Ubuntu, and MacOS. Doesn’t seam to want to work on Cygwin.

Things encrypted in this program, aren’t necessarily required to be decrypted using this program… this just makes it easier to play around with this encryption using a user friendly command line interface.

If it doesn’t execute run ‘chmod +x encFun.sh’.

To run/use ‘./easyFileCrypt-cli.sh’ after you navigate into the directory where it is stored.
